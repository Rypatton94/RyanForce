## About

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Go (built with Go 1.24.1)
3. Open terminal, cd into project folder

Run CLI mode (default):

```bash
go run main.go
```

Run WebUI mode:

```bash
go run main.go web
```

Run and reseed database before starting CLI mode:

```bash
go run main.go seed
```

Run and reseed database before starting WebUI mode:

```bash
go run main.go web seed
```

- If you include `seed`, RyanForce will wipe and reload demo accounts, techs, clients, and tickets before starting.
- If you leave it out, it will just start normally without reseeding.

When running WebUI mode, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Log files will show up under `logs/ryanforce.log`

---

## Seeding Demo Data

- When you run the program for the first time, RyanForce automatically seeds the database if no users are found.
- The seed will create:
  - One admin account
  - Several techs with different skill sets
  - Clients attached to mock companies
  - A mix of assigned and unassigned support tickets
- Admins can also manually wipe and reseed the database by using the `clear-db` command in the CLI.

### Seeded User Credentials

- Admin:
  - Email: `admin@example.com`
  - Password: `Admin123!`
- Techs:
  - Alice Anderson
    - Email: `alice.tech@example.com`
    - Password: `Tech123!`
  - Bob Brown
    - Email: `bob.tech@example.com`
    - Password: `Tech123!`
  - Charlie Clark
